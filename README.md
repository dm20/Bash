# Helpful Command Line/Bash Stuff
Some bash scripts and lines I use on the command line that may be useful to others.

I'm on a MacBook Pro using Terminal

### One of the single most useful and powerful tools ever is Homebrew. 
It allows you to install all sorts of packages from the command line and is extremely easy to use, like this:
    
    brew intsall php
    
<a href= "https://brew.sh" >Download Homebrew</a>
